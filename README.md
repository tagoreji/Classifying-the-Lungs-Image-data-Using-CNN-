# Classifying-the-Lungs-Image-data-Using-CNN
Aim of this Project is to build a CNN Model to classify lung infection using Medical Imagery

Data Augmentataion for both train 7 test data were performed.

CNN Model were built with different filters, max pool layers, dropout layers, and batch normalization layers.
Transfer Learning is done with Mobile Net & DenseNet121 Models 
And Relevant Accuracy & Loss graphs were being plotted.
